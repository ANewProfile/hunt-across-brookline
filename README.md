# Hunt Across Brookline

Hunt Across Brookline is a scavenger hunt that encourages participants of all ages to visit different parts of Brookline. The app will have location tracking and puzzles that require participants to use critical thinking to navigate their way around town.

The prototype of the app will be an iOS app, written by me in the Swift programming language, and the app might expand to Android or a website. The prototype will contain about 5-8 locations per scavenger hunt. There would be three locations for scavenger hunts (Main, Putterham, and Coolidge Corner branches of the Brookline Public Library) and each location would have two levels, easy (ages 11 and below) and difficult (ages 12 and above). The scavenger hunts could be periodically updated based on the popularity and success of the app. After completing the scavenger hunt, participants will receive the option to donate to the Brookline Public Library and could receive a complimentary prize at the libraryâ€™s discretion.
